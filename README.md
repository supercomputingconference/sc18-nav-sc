# Navigating SC 2018

The Navigating SC sessions help bring order to the chaos.
They give an overview of many things that are happening during SC week and help attendees figure out how to make the most of their time.

These slides were created using the [SC18 Beamer Theme](https://github.com/supercomputingconference/sc18-beamer-theme)
